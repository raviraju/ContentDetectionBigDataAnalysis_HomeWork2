Abstract
Language identification has been an interesting and fascinating issue in natural language processing
for decades, and there have been many researches on it. However, most of the researches are for
documents, and though the possibility of high accuracy for shorter strings of characters, language
identification for words or phrases has not been discussed much. In this paper we propose a
statistical method of language identification for phrases, and show the empirical results for person
names of 9 languages (12 areas). Our simple method based on n-gram and phrase length obtained
more than 90% of accuracy for Japanese, Korean and Russian, and fair results for other languages
except English. This result indicated the possibility of language identification for person names
based on statistics, which is useful in multi-language person name detection and also let us expect
the possibility of language identification for phrases with simple statistics-based methods.
1. Introduction
The technology of language identification has become more important with the growth of the
WWW. As Grefenstette reported in their paper (Grefenstette 2000) non-English languages are
growing in recent years on the WWW, and the need for automatic language identification for both
documents and phrases are increasing. An easy method for language identification must be a key
for better accuracy rate in natural language processing, such as information retrieval and machine
translation.
Language identification is not a new topic in natural language processing. Bastrup proposed a
unigram-based decision-tree method for language identification (Bastrup 2003). Dunning reported
that 20 bytes are enough to obtain 92% accuracy in language identification (Dunning 1994). His
method was based on statistical information, and it did not use any accented characters which
would be a great help in identifying. This result is very encouraging for applying statistical
language identification to proper nouns. Language identification is also well examined as speech
recognition task (Matrouf 1998, Schultz 1996, Hazen 1994a, Hazen 1994b, Lamel 1994, Berkling
1994). Caseiro and Trancoso introduced a method using one language phone recognizer and less
linguistic information for the language identification of speech (Caseiro 1998) .
2. Language Identification for Person Names
Person name is one of the most frequent foreign phrases in texts, and it often causes noise as
unknown words. Thus language identification of person names can be a help for better accuracy in
text processing. However, there are several difficulties in identifying the language of a person
name. First, the language of a person name may not match the official language of the area.
Second, person names are international and not as language-specific as other words. Third, person
names are often not long enough for analysis, and it is even possible to have name words in
different languages in a full name. There can be found names in non-official languages of the areafor many reasons such as international naming, international marriage or migration. And it is also
difficult to identify a single language to a name, as there are common names used in several
languages. So it is not practical to identify the language of a person name, however, to identify the
area to where a person name belong should be possible with statistical data.
3. Statistics in Person Names
It is well known that each language has its own n-gram frequency (Dunning 1994). Our person
name list corpora also have language-specific n-gram frequency in person names.
Thus we examined the possibility of language identification for person names based only on
automatically-extractable statistical information. Nobesawa et al. proposed methods on obtaining
domain-specific phrases using automatically-extractable statistical information only (Nobesawa
2002, Nobesawa 2000). Thus we examined the possibility of language identification for person
names based only on automatically-extractable statistical information.
3.1. Corpora
We use person name lists for both training corpora and test corpora.
Our system requires statistical data extracted automatically from training corpora, and estimates
the likelihood of each name belonging to each language.
3.1.1.
Name Corpora by Areas
We prepared person name lists in 9 languages and made 12 person name corpora by areas (English
(United Kingdom, United States), Chinese (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), German,
French, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Thai.
As for person names, it is almost impossible to decide a single nationality to each name. Thus
we work on area identification rather than language identification for person names, according to
sets of names found in academic organization websites on the WWW. We can not avoid foreign
names being noise with these data.
The size of the corpora varies, from at most 18,119 full names for Germany corpus to at least
5,764 full names for Greece corpora. Average number of full names in a corpus is 10,903 (Table 1).
The basic data of the name corpora are shown in Table 1. “Name” in Table 1 means full names,
“word” is for name words such as a single family name or a single given name, including initials.
Table 1 also includes average number of words in a full name and average number of characters in
a name word in each name corpus.

3.1.2. Notation
Our system does not use the advantage of language-specified accented characters. We excluded
names with accented characters from the corpora. Thus the corpora do not include, for example,
“Uta Müller,” but they may include “Uta Muller” and “Uta Mueller.”
The corpora contain names with initials, such as “A.B. Chan” and “Ann B. Chan.” This has
influence on the numbers per word/name in Table 1 and Figure 2, for the ratio of names with
initials differ between the corpora. Some areas such as Hong Kong and Russia show tendency to
have more initials.
3.2. Statistics in Person Names
Our system uses the statistical data of person names in the name corpora in Section 3.1.
3.2.1. Length
Names have small differences in their names according to the areas. The overall average number of
characters in a full name is 16.19. Chinese and Korean is shorter in average, and Russian and Thai
are longer.
Full-Name Length (Number of Words in a Full-Name) A Hong Kong name has 2.81 words on
average, which is a unique feature (Table 1). A Chinese name is basically made of three characters,
one for family name and succeeding two for a given name. But the basic notations of the names in
Latin alphabet are different in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. So-called English names are more
common in Hong Kong, and many people put English names to/instead of Chinese given names.
Thus there is variety of notation of names in Hong Kong. In Korea, person names are made of
three words like in Chinese, and some people separate their given names in two words when
writing in Latin alphabet. This is the main reason of having name-length average rather longer in
Hong Kong and Korea comparing to other Asian areas.
In Russia the most frequent full-name length is three, where two is common in most of
languages. Russian names have longer words than other languages, and this length information
helps in distinguishing Russian from others, as Thai and Greek which also have longer words
contain only two words in a name.
Word Length (Number of Characters in a Name Word) The average number of characters in a
name word was 7.08 and the average number of name words in a full name was 2.20.
Figure 1: Average number of characters per word/full name of each corpus
As for the word length, Russian, Thai and Greece have slightly longer words. Figure 1 shows that
there can be three groups according to the length; shorter-word group for 3 Chinese Areas and
Korea, middle-length group for Europe, U.S.A. and Japan, and longer-word group for Thailand,
Greece and Russia. Shorter-word group is tending to have approximately 6 characters. Japaneseseems to be unique in Asian languages, as it has 8 letters in a word on average, which is more alike
to middle-length group (Figure 2).

As shown in Table 2, the ratio of characters differs with the areas.
Basic five vowels are emphasized in Table 2. ‘A’ and ‘I’ are frequent in almost all the corpora.
However, for the Korea corpus ‘A’ and ‘I’ are the least frequent vowels, which is very different
from other corpora. ‘U’ has high frequency in Asian corpora, but not in European corpora. ‘E’ is
also frequent in most corpora, but the frequency rate differ comparing European corpora and Asian
corpora.
‘Z’ and ‘Q’ are almost not used in 11 corpora, but are found in the China corpus, which is even
different from the Hong Kong corpus and the Taiwan corpus. ‘V’ is also almost not used, but it is
the most frequent consonant in the Russia corpus. ‘K’ is not a frequent character in most of the
corpora, but it is the most frequent consonant in the Japan corpus. ‘T’ has low frequency ratio in
Chinese corpora and the Korea corpus, but the ratio is more than 5% in Japan, Thailand, Greece and
Germany.Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19 th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation.
Bigram There are language-specific features in bigram data as well. Bigrams mostly show the
features of areas in vowel cooccurrences and consonant cooccurrences. Sometimes they are more
area-specific rather than language-specific.
Trigram Trigram provides the specific features of the areas. The frequency rankings of trigrams
differ between the areas, and high-ranked trigrams are the keys of high accuracy rate in area
identification.
4. Identification Based on Statistical Information
Our system is fully based on statistical information. The system takes one full name as an input and
outputs the possibility value for the input full name belonging to each name corpus.
4.1. Corpora
We used the name corpora explained in Section 3.1 as the test corpora for the experiments. Though
the experiments were on closed corpora, the system may not be able to obtain 100% accuracy
because of the foreign names included in the corpora.
4.2. Language Identification Methods Based on Statistical Data
The algorithm is the same for all the methods. The system calculates the possibility to belong to an
area using the statistical data extracted from the name corpus. The estimation is calculated
independently for each name corpus, thus the summation of the possibility ratio for each area is not
100%. This is because one name may have more than one area to belong, or no area, according to
the listing up of the test areas. After examining all the areas, the system outputs the best-scored
area as the result of the area identification of the input full name.
A Method Based on Length The system uses full-name length and word length as statistical data
for estimation. This is rather a negative method to filter out areas with low possibility.
A Method Based on N-gram The system uses n-gram data for estimation. We had four patterns:
unigram only, bigram only, trigram only, and interpolated trigram. Interpolated trigram is to avoid
the problem of sparseness with trigram, and the system introduces bigrams for the gap. If the
system finds lack of both trigram and bigram for a string, then unigram is used for interpolation.
For bigrams and unigrams, the possibility value is reduced with certain weights.
A Method Based on N-gram and Length The system uses both interpolated trigram and length
data for estimation. The weights for the two data should be controlled, and for the experiments in
this paper interpolated trigram is more weighted so that length data is used as a support to raise the
accuracy.
4.3. Empirical Results
We had experiments on area identification for the 12 name corpora. Table 3 shows the ratio of full
names successfully estimated with our statistical methods. The results showed at most around 90%
accuracy for four corpora (Japan, Russia, Korea and Thailand). Another four corpora showed 70%
to 80% accuracy (Greece, Taiwan, Germany and China), and two corpora showed more than 60%
accuracy (France and Hong Kong). The accuracy rate for U.K. was 59.18% and 50.88% for U.S.A.
The accuracy rates were mostly good for most areas except English-speaking areas.
Table 3 indicated that interpolated n-gram was efficient for most of the corpora, and the system
raised its accuracy rate slightly by combining length data and n-gram data. Length data were not
efficient enough for an independent use, but they never decreased the accuracy when used
combined with n-gram data.
From the results we recognized two groups of areas; the European-American group and the
Chinese group. The European-American group includes U.K., U.S.A., France and Germany.
Chinese group includes China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The name corpora which belong to these
groups showed lower accuracy rates, as they are often confused and mistaken between the areas inthe same group. Obviously it is natural to have such area groups, and it can be said that we
succeeded in recognition of area groups only with statistical information. Name corpora not
included in the two area groups showed higher accuracy rates.

The results in Table 3 show that it is possible to distinguish person names according to the areas
they belong to. This is an encouraging result for simple language identification for phrases.
4.4. The Method Based on Length
The method based on length data was not efficient enough for most of the corpora. The best
accuracy rate was 69.64% for Russia corpora. China, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand obtained
around 50% accuracy with length data, but for European corpora it was almost impossible to
distinguish the area lists only with this length data. This was because length data did not have
enough information for positive identification, and the data could only find out names with
irregular length.
4.5. The Methods Based on N-grams
Methods based on n-grams showed better accuracy rates comparing to the length data (Table 3).
The Method Based on Unigram Unigram is useful for filtering out the names with infrequent
alphabets. Unlike bigram or trigram, unigram works rather negative at that point.
Unigram data showed difference in efficiency. The Russia corpus gained 78.44% accuracy rate
only with character unigram data. Greece, China and Japan also gained accuracy rate more than
70%, and Taiwan, Korea and Germany gained more than 60%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate
was only 0.48% for the U.K. corpus. About half of the names in the U.K. corpus were misjudged
to belong to U.S.A., and 30% to Germany. The U.S.A. corpus obtained 38.12% accuracy, but 30%
of U.S.A. names were also misjudged to be German. The U.K. corpus and the U.S.A. corpus had
almost the same result with unigram data, which sounds natural. The Hong Kong corpus also
showed low accuracy rate (12.53%) with unigram data. The mixture of Chinese names and English
names in notation was the main reason for this low accuracy.
The Method Based on Bigram With bigram data, the accuracy rates obviously rose comparing to
the experiment with unigram. Bigram data were efficient enough for seven name corpora to show
more than 70% accuracy. The best was 89.58% for the Russia corpus. Hong Kong, France,
Germany and U.K. showed accuracy around 50%, and U.S.A. could gain only 28.97% accuracy
with bigram data. There were confusion in U.K., U.S.A., Germany and France.Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19 th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation.
The Method Based on Trigram Trigram data showed better accuracy rates than unigram and
bigram in ten corpora. Trigram can evaluate the areas’ specific sequences of characters better than
unigram and bigram, but person names are made of short strings of characters and the influence of
data sparseness caused noise. For China the accuracy rate according to trigram data got down to
65.10%, from 71.61% with bigram. Accuracy rate with trigram was even worse than the rate with
unigram for the China corpus. The Russia corpus also showed lower accuracy rate with trigram
(85.75%) comparing to the rate with bigram (89.58%). For the U.S.A. corpus the rate rose to
43.40% with trigram data, though there still was the confusion in the European-American corpora
The Method Based on Interpolated Trigram Eleven out of twelve corpora raised their accuracy
rate by using interpolated trigram, comparing to plain n-gram data. For the China corpus, the
accuracy rate with interpolated trigram was 71.38%, which was a bit lower than 71.61% with
bigram, and even lower than 71.57% of unigram. But the accuracy rate with trigram for the China
corpus was 65.10%. Using interpolated trigram, the system almost recovered the loss.
4.6. The Method Based on Interpolated Trigram and Length
The main estimation method in this paper was the combination of length data and n-gram data
(Table 3). With this method we succeeded in obtaining the best accuracy rates for all the 12 name
corpora, including the China corpus. Length data were not efficient enough to distinguish areas,
but the data helped to raise the accuracy rates, by wiping out the full names with exceptional length.
Table 4 shows the ratio of areas in the output for each test corpora. The sum of the values in
each row is 100%. In Table 4, 75.58% of names in the China corpus were estimated to belong to
China, 16.51% to Taiwan, and 3.30% to Hong Kong. Table 4 shows that our system succeeded in
distinction of the three Chinese-speaking areas, and also it indicates that the system identified
95.39% names of China corpus belong to Chinese-speaking areas.

On the other hand, the accuracy rates of the U.K. corpus and the U.S.A. corpus are low. The U.K.
corpus and the U.S.A. corpus are both in English language, and the system could not distinguish
them. 81.97% of the names in the U.K. corpus were judged to belong to U.K. or U.S.A., and
71.31% in U.S.A. corpora was judged to be English. The U.S.A. corpus showed difficulty in area
identification, which is because it contains more foreign (non-English) names than other corpora.
This also caused misjudges for other corpora to belong to U.S.A.
4.7. Person Name Area Groups
The results show that the corpora can be divided into area groups according to their person names.
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong make an area group according to the results such as Table 2.
Those three corpora showed similarities both in length and in n-gram data, which is natural becauseof the language they share. However, it was possible to distinguish these three with high accuracy
rates with our method. This shows that our method obtained and used the areas’ features efficiently.
France, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A. also make an area group. But for the English-speaking areas,
area identification was not very successful.
Other five name corpora (Japan, Korea, Thailand, Russia, and Greece) could be distinguished
from others with high accuracy rates. Our method based on both length data and n-gram data
enabled to estimate the likelihood of belonging to the areas.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a method for identifying languages of person names based only on
statistical information. We had experiments with name corpora of 12 areas (9 languages), and
showed that it was possible to identify the areas of person names only with statistical data. As the
best results, we succeeded to obtain accuracy rates over 90% for Korea, Japan and Russia corpora.
And also, we confirmed that our system recognized area groups based on languages.
This paper showed the possibility of automatic language identification of person names in Latin
alphabet based only on automatically-extractable statistical information. We expect that better
results lead us to better language identification not only for person names but for other phrases.
