The objective of the assignment is to significantly enrich the metadata, and automatically extracted text and entities from the TREC Polar Dataset, and to make the dataset easily to relate to and to interact with. To do so, we will apply and leverage knowledge gained from context extraction, metadata, information similarity and clustering, and from the named entity recognition lectures. To do this, the assignment is broken down into several phases, which more or less can be mapped to: 1. Context Extraction Enrichment – Apply the Tag Ratios algorithm to identify text, and construct a Tika parser to extract Measurement mentions from text automatically. 2. Metadata Enrichment – Apply the GROBID journal parser with Tika, and extract TEI metadata, and also scientific publication metadata using the Google Scholar API to develop a network of related scientific publications to Polar dataset, and to map publications to the data. In addition, classify the data using a common Earth science domain model, ontology, called SWEET, for Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/). Create Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for your data. 3. Information Similarity and Clustering – Create clusters of Polar data using the enriched measurements extracted, and using the enriched metadata, and browse and expose information using Data-Driven-Documents visualizations after ingesting data into Apache Solr and/or ElasticSearch. 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Apply geospatial NER using the GeoTopicParser in Apache Tika and using the MEMEX GeoParser tools.
