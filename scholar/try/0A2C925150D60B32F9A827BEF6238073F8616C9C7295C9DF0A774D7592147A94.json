This bill would require the Regents of the University of California and the Trustees of the California State University to determine the amounts of undergraduate tuition and mandatory systemwide fees for California residents in each incoming first-year class in their respective segments. The tuition and mandatory systemwide fees set for California residents in each incoming first-year class shall not be increased until that incoming first-year class has completed at least four academic years. While the University acknowledges the need to address the rising cost of education, it is our belief that AB 138 is premature and the application of the multi-year tuition schedule should be contingent on maintenance of effort by the State. The University, through the Commission on the Future, has previously examined adopting a multi-year tuition schedule and will be tasking the President&apos;s tuition working group to do the same. This type of tuition policy significantly reduces flexibility in tuition revenue. Since continuing students would be assured a fixed tuition increase rate, any revenue required beyond that amount, due to a sudden decline in State funding, for example, would have to be generated by the students who would be subject to the &quot; new &quot; student rate and capping that new student rate at a 5 percent increase between cohorts (as proposed to be amended) ties the University&apos;s hands even further. In addition, application of the multi-year tuition schedule should be contingent on maintenance of effort by the State. In the case of significant and abrupt State budget cuts, the University might need to adopt an emergency tuition increase outside of the scheduled amount. The proposed language does not take into consideration that tuition is an essential revenue source for the University. This revenue benefits all students by helping to maintain the quality of a UC education, course availability, access to talented faculty, etc. Equally important, however, is the critical role it plays in UC&apos;s ability to remain accessible to financially needy students. Increases in systemwide tuition and fees generate funding for UC&apos;s own institutional aid program due to the University&apos;s practice of setting aside a portion of new revenue for need-based aid. This aid, roughly $630 million in 2012-13, helps UC undergraduates cover both tuition and other expenses like housing, books and supplies.</p>\n\t\t\t</abstract>\n\t\t</profileDesc>\n\t</teiHeader>\n\t<text xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t</text>\n</TEI>\n"
